        <div class="about">Monticello Flying Club is an established non-profit 
            flying club located in Charlottesville Virginia. We incorporated in 
            April 2013 and currently have 12 flying members and 4 social members. 
            We own a Mooney M20F and the local flight school has also given us reduced 
            rental rate on a G1000 equipped, 180hp Cessna 172. We still have 
            memberships available, so if you are interested in finding out more about 
            becoming a member, please e-mail membership@monticellofc.org and feel 
            free to look around the website.
